Creating a checkout session

-> Need an endpoint that creates a checkout session.
== Everytime a customer intends to pay, their is a new checkout session created with a new ID,if they were to cancel it, and intent to pay again
they would have to a new checkout session ID

Choosing a mode

-> For one time apyment you need to use payment mode

Supply success and cancel URLs

-> Specify success and cancel pages.

Redirect to checkout

-> After creating the session, redirect your customer to the URL for the checkout Page.

----------------------- CLIENT ---------------------------------------------

ADD A SUCCESS PAGE

-> Create pages for success and cancled orders


------ We need to connect the STRIPE DASHABORD TO THE WEBSITE -------------------

---------------------------------- HOW IT WORKS ------------------------------------------

We have a route.ts file within checkout folder that creates a checkout session.

The function to call that API is in another folder call components/buyButton
-> Where if you click the button then it calls that route.ts file.

Within the API call you have to pass in the price_ID and it looks into the stripe DASHABORD and retrieves that price. 

You fill out a payment form and then click pay.

Depending on the card, it will either fail or success and redirect you to the correct page.
Depending on the card, it will either fail or success and redirect you to the correct page.

---------------------------------- Creating Product ------------------------------------------

I have the products to where if the use creates a product it gets stored in the database
-> UH_Market_Place\uhmarketplace\src\app\(cb)\dashboard\page.tsx -> This is where the initial listing occurs for the user
-> uhmarketplace\src\app\create_post\page.tsx -> This is where the user actually creates the listing 


Problem is, it doesnt get stored in the stripe dashbaord, and thats where the payment processor will actually take place

*** It seems like you can have it do CRUD operations within the same API call, it doesnt really need to have two different functions

GOAL::: FINISHED
Be able to understand how to implement stripe within the application


WHAT I LEARNED
-> You can do crud operations for both stripe and database within a function::: EX UH_Market_Place\uhmarketplace\src\app\api\listings\route.ts
-> You can not delete products through the API, so the best option you have is to archive it, and once you do that, you would have 
to run the list of products where products = "Active"

What I need to do for next time
-> I can delete products from the dashboard of stripe, but it will still be there in the database
-> Everytime I load up the marketplace, it would have to compare all the products of the database and the stripe dashbaord, and see 
if it matches, if one isnt matching then it will adjust accordingly 

When it comes to deleting, it will delete from the database but it will archive in the stripe dashboard.

Text Isreal about the frontend since the website is lacking front end, just have him do the home page since it will be the easiest

What is Hydration

When using Next.js hyrdation is the process wehre the client side Teact application teakes over the server rendering HTMK and attaches events handlers,state, etc,
so the page becomes interactive

If the HTML on th server is different from what React expects on the client, you get this warning.
