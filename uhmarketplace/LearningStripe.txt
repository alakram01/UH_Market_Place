Creating a checkout session

-> Need an endpoint that creates a checkout session.
== Everytime a customer intends to pay, their is a new checkout session created with a new ID,if they were to cancel it, and intent to pay again
they would have to a new checkout session ID

Choosing a mode

-> For one time apyment you need to use payment mode

Supply success and cancel URLs

-> Specify success and cancel pages.

Redirect to checkout

-> After creating the session, redirect your customer to the URL for the checkout Page.

----------------------- CLIENT ---------------------------------------------

ADD A SUCCESS PAGE

-> Create pages for success and cancled orders


------ We need to connect the STRIPE DASHABORD TO THE WEBSITE -------------------

---------------------------------- HOW IT WORKS ------------------------------------------

We have a route.ts file within checkout folder that creates a checkout session.

The function to call that API is in another folder call components/buyButton
-> Where if you click the button then it calls that route.ts file.

Within the API call you have to pass in the price_ID and it looks into the stripe DASHABORD and retrieves that price. 

You fill out a payment form and then click pay.

Depending on the card, it will either fail or success and redirect you to the correct page.
